# 🪟 Windows Uncracker for Mac

**Ever felt your macOS was just _too_ clean, _too_ polished, and _too_... Mac?**  
Miss the nostalgia of that _activate Windows_ watermark staring you down, questioning your life choices? Well, worry no more!

Introducing **Windows Uncracker for Mac** – the app that does the exact opposite of what you’d expect. Instead of cracking your macOS experience, it _uncracks_ it with style by adding the legendary _Activate Windows_ watermark to your Mac.

## 🎯 Features

✅ Authentic Windows™ watermark simulation
✅ Watermark automatically adjusts to your screen resolution – because quality matters.  
✅ Lightweight – it takes up less space than your existential dread.

## 🤔 Why?

Why not? Imagine running your sleek, expensive MacBook Pro with that sweet reminder that your “Windows” isn’t activated. Nothing screams irony louder than this.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GR0SST/Windows-Uncracker-for-mac.git
    ```
2. Build the app and run it

This app serves no purpose other than to make your Mac look hilariously questionable. Use it responsibly. Or don’t. I’m not your IT admin.
